# Near Transaction Serializer

## Introduction
We are on a mission to build a Flutter library to help Flutter developers build mobile apps for the NEAR Protocol. We were unable to port all of the functionality to Dart at this time, so we have decided to host this project online and temporarily offer some of the functionality to any mobile developers.


## Current Available Features

- Serialize Transaction 
Given the transaction details like sender, receiver, publick key,... , this call will decode serialzie the transaction object and return it back to you. 

- serializeSignedTransaction
Given the signed version of the transaction including transaction details like sender, receiver, publick key,... , this call will decode serialzie the transaction object and return it back to you.
